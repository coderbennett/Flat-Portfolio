        <div class="vl"></div>
        <p>I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent.
            I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Just go
            back and put one little more happy tree in there. Everybody's different. Trees
            are different. Let them all be individuals.<br><br>
           
           We'll put some happy little leaves here and there. These things happen automatically.</p>
